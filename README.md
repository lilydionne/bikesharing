### Summary
Based on our analysis, we understand that bikesharing activity predominately occurs according to work hours. With this detail we estimate that subscibers have more activity during the week because they are using the service to commute to work. Two takeaways and requests for addtional analysis from this report are: 
 - We recommend acquring data on usage by subscriber to calculate metrics such as rides per user.
 - We recommend pull reports for weekdays separately from weekend, given that weekdays have such as large impact on the data.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing next steps on the Des Moines bike-sharing proposal.
