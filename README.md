### Summary
Based on our analysis, we understand that bikesharing activity predominately occurs according to work hours. With this detail we estimate that subscibers have more activity during the week because they are using the service to commute to work. For further analysis we may want to try variable pricing during peak times to determine optimal pricing strategies. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to discussing next steps on the Des Moines bike-sharing proposal.
